## Headline specifications

* Any signed-up user can list a new space.

* Users can list multiple spaces.

* Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.

* Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.

* Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.

* Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space.

* Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.

## Nice-to-haves
* Users should receive an email whenever one of the following happens:
	- They sign up
	- They create a space
	- They update a space

* A user requests to book their space
	- They confirm a request
	- They request to book a space
	- Their request to book a space is confirmed
	- Their request to book a space is denied

* Users should receive a text message to a provided number whenever one of the following happens:
	- A user requests to book their space
	- Their request to book a space is confirmed
	- Their request to book a space is denied

* A ‘chat’ functionality once a space has been booked, allowing users whose space-booking request has been confirmed to chat with the user that owns that space.

* Basic payment implementation though Stripe.
